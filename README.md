Event Types:  Source Data Object Options

* Event (0): data that may change for each instance of the thing happening (e.g., "this escalation went to $team", "this notification was sent to $distribution", etc.).
    
* Ticket (1): data that will only change for different incidents but not different events within one timeline (e.g., "ticket 100 has severity 1", "ticket 101 has severity 2", etc.).
    
* EventType (2): data that will be the same for every event of a given type.
    
* Engagement (3): data that will reflect the current user (which should be relatively rare).
